# GCN_WeedDetection

This is a project for COMP 449/559 focused on using Graph Convolutional Networks for Weed Detection inspired by this previously published paper: [CNN feature based graph convolutional network for weed and crop recognition in smart farming](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168169919321349?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=8794e9bc9c293156). 

Run "source setup.sh" on command line to install required packages and datasets. 
Then run experiments 1-4 for CNN Training and 5-8 for GCN Training. 

Further details are available in the project report.
